# **Personal Expense Tracker Using Python**

## Project Overview

The **Personal Expense Tracker** is a Python-based application that allows users to efficiently track and manage their personal finances. Developed as a part of my mini project during my internship with **Vault of Codes**, this application offers users the ability to record, categorize, and analyze their expenses, while also providing visual insights through graphs generated by **Matplotlib**.

---

## Key Features

- **Add Expenses**: Easily input details such as the date, category, amount, and description for every expense.
- **View Summary**: View a detailed breakdown of your total spending, including a category-wise distribution of expenses.
- **Data Persistence**: All data is saved to a CSV or JSON file, ensuring it remains available between sessions.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Navigate through the app seamlessly with a simple text-based menu.
- **Edit or Delete Records**: Edit or remove any entry in the expense list to keep your records accurate.
- **Graphical Insights**: Visualize your spending patterns with dynamic pie charts and bar graphs powered by **Matplotlib**.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Data Storage**: CSV or JSON files for storing expense data
- **Data Visualization**: **Matplotlib** for generating insightful visualizations
- **Development Environment**: Python IDE or Jupyter Notebook

## How It Works

### 1. **Add Expense**
Users can add new expenses by specifying:
  - **Date**: The date the expense occurred
  - **Category**: The category of the expense (e.g., Food, Transport, Entertainment)
  - **Amount**: The amount of money spent
  - **Description**: A brief description of the expense
The expense is then saved to a file for future reference.

### 2. **View Summary**
Users can access:
  - **Total Expenses**: The overall spending up to the current point
  - **Category Breakdown**: A categorized summary of the expenses
  - **Expense List**: A full list of all recorded expenses with their respective details

### 3. **Data Persistence**
Expense data is saved to a CSV or JSON file. This ensures that users' data persists between sessions, so they can access their history and keep track of their financial progress.

### 4. **User Menu**
The application provides an intuitive, text-based menu that lets users:
  - Add a new expense
  - View summaries and statistics
  - Edit or delete existing records
  - Generate graphical visualizations
  - Exit the application

### 5. **Edit or Delete Record**
Users can modify existing expense entries or delete them if needed, allowing for flexibility in managing their expenses.

### 6. **Graphical Summaries**
The application uses **Matplotlib** to generate insightful visualizations, including:
  - **Bar Graphs**: Displaying total expenses over time or by category
